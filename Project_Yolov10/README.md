# Image Detection Project Using Yolov10

This folder contains notebooks deploying simple Image Detection Project Using Yolov10:

## Usage

**I. Safety Helmet Detection:** 

Fine tunning the model with dataset from 
https://universe.roboflow.com/dataperson/safety-helmet-dataset-uvh1t/

1. Upload file "Safety_Helmet_Training.ipynb" to Colab and follow the steps in the file
2. You can try Pre-trained model by uploading file "pretrained_best" to Colab and replacing the TRAINED_MODEL_PATH in step 6 & 7 and run steps 4 & 7

**I. Mask Wearing Detection:** 

Fine tunning the model with dataset from 
https://universe.roboflow.com/roboflow-universe-projects/mask-wearing-iskms/dataset/6

1. Upload file "Mask_Wearing_Training.ipynb" to Colab and follow the steps in the file
2. You can try Pre-trained model by uploading file "pretrained_best" to Colab and replacing the TRAINED_MODEL_PATH in step 6 & 7 and run steps 4 & 7
